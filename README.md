- Quiz Game
The first Python game is called Quiz Game. In this quiz game, you have to know what the acronyms mean. If you get the correct answer, it will show that you got the correct answers and at the end, you can see how many questions you got right with the percentage as well. Case sensitive is corrected in python so the answer is correct even if it's typed in all upper case.
